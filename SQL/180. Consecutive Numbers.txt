# Write your MySQL query statement below

#Create a table with next and next2next value
#Ids are missing in testcases so adding addition check of ids
WITH cte AS
(SELECT *, LEAD(num, 1) OVER() AS num_1, LEAD(num, 2) OVER() AS num_2, LEAD(id, 1) OVER() AS id_1, LEAD(id, 2) OVER() AS id_2
FROM logs
ORDER BY id)

#From that table, find distinct num with all 3 consecutive values being equal
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM cte
WHERE num = num_1
AND num = num_2
AND id_1 = id + 1
AND id_2 = id + 2




Solution 2 using join

# Write your MySQL query statement below

#This code will join columns only if ids are also incremental
#and then compare num in where clause
select 
    distinct logs1.num as ConsecutiveNums 
from 
    logs logs1 join logs logs2 join logs logs3
on 
    logs1.id = logs2.id - 1
    and
    logs2.id = logs3.id - 1
where 
    logs1.num = logs2.num 
    and 
    logs2.num = logs3.num;
